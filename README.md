## Overview

**Filmix** is a full-stack, multi-page platform designed for users to explore and manage their favorite movies and TV series. The app allows users to navigate through various sections, bookmark shows, and manage their profiles. It also includes an admin dashboard for managing content and users.

Building this app was a key learning experience for me, as it was my first interaction with Next.js. Through this project, I familiarized myself with the Next.js App Router and the full-stack development workflow.

## Live Demo

You can access the live deployed version of Filmix at: [https://filmix-app.vercel.app/](https://filmix-app.vercel.app/)

## Features

### User Features

- **Multi-page Navigation**: Users can seamlessly navigate between Home, Movies, TV Series, and Bookmarked Shows pages.
- **Account Management**: Users can upload an avatar, update their about information, or delete their account from the Account page.
- **Bookmarking**: Add or remove bookmarks from the list of movies and TV series.
- **Search Functionality**: Search for relevant shows across all pages.
- **Authentication**: Users can sign up, log in, and access protected content based on their roles (admin or user).
- **Cloudinary Integration**: User avatars and show thumbnails are stored securely using Cloudinary.

### Admin Features

- **Admin Dashboard**: Admins can access a dedicated dashboard to manage the platform.
- **Shows Management**: Overview and management of the movies and TV series available on the platform.
- **User Management**: Admins can view and manage user accounts.

### Additional Pages & Features

This project is based on a [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/entertainment-web-app-J-UhgAW1X) challenge, where the design data and requirements were provided. However, I've extended the project by adding several additional pages and functionalities:

- **Admin Dashboard**
- **Shows and Users Management**
- **User Account Page**
- **Help Centre**
- **Dropdown Menu** in the header for user options

## Work in Progress

Some pages and functionalities are still under development:

- **Markup Incomplete**: The markup on the following pages is not fully completed yet:

  - `/dashboard`
  - `/app/movies/[showId]`
  - `/app/shows/[showId]`
  - `/app/help-centre`

  The delay in completing these pages is due to the focus on implementing core functionalities and familiarizing with new technologies.

- **Disabled Features**: Some buttons on the additional pages are currently disabled and display a "coming soon" tooltip. These include:

  - **Filter**: Filtering options on tables
  - **Export Table**: Functionality to export table data
  - **Add Show/User**: Adding new shows or users
  - **Edit/Delete Show**: Editing or deleting existing shows

  These features are planned for future improvements.

   ```

3. Set up the environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following variables:

4. Initialize the Prisma client and push the database schema:

   ```bash
   npx prisma generate
   npx prisma db push
   ```

5. Seed the initial data:

   ```bash
   npx prisma db seed
   ```

6. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

7. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Deployment

The app is deployed on Vercel. To deploy your own version:

1. Push your code to a GitHub repository.
2. Link the repository to Vercel.
3. Set the necessary environment variables in Vercel.
4. Deploy the app directly from Vercel.

## Future Improvements

- **Complete Markup**: Finalize the markup for the incomplete pages.
